Installation
------------

Add it to your ``Cargo.toml``:

.. code-block:: toml

   [dependencies]
   snips-nlu-lib = { git = "https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu-rs", branch = "master" }

Add ``extern crate snips_nlu_lib`` to your crate root and you are good to go!


Intent Parsing with Snips NLU
-----------------------------

The purpose of the main crate of this repository, ``snips-nlu-lib``, is to perform an information
extraction task called *intent parsing*.

Letâ€™s take an example to illustrate the main purpose of this lib, and consider the following sentence:

.. code-block:: text

   "What will be the weather in paris at 9pm?"

Properly trained, the Snips NLU engine will be able to extract structured data such as:

.. code-block:: json

   {
      "intent": {
         "intentName": "searchWeatherForecast",
         "confidenceScore": 0.95
      },
      "slots": [
         {
            "value": "paris",
            "entity": "locality",
            "slotName": "forecast_locality"
         },
         {
            "value": {
               "kind": "InstantTime",
               "value": "2018-02-08 20:00:00 +00:00"
            },
            "entity": "snips/datetime",
            "slotName": "forecast_start_datetime"
         }
      ]
   }


In order to achieve such a result, the NLU engine needs to be fed with a trained model (json file).
This repository only contains the inference part, in order to produce trained models please check
the `Snips NLU python library <https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu>`_.


Example and API Usage
---------------------

The `interactive parsing CLI <examples/interactive_parsing_cli.rs>`_  is a good example
of to how to use ``snips-nlu-rs``.

Here is how you can run the CLI example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu-rs
   $ cd snips-nlu-rs
   $ cargo run --example interactive_parsing_cli data/tests/models/nlu_engine

Here we used a sample trained engine, which consists in two intents: ``MakeCoffee`` and ``MakeTea``.
Thus, it will be able to parse queries like ``"Make me two cups of coffee please"`` or ``"I'd like a hot tea"``.

As mentioned in the previous section, you can train your own nlu engine with the
`Snips NLU python library <https://github.com/snipsco/snips-nlu>`_.
